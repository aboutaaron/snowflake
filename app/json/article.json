Paul LePage. Only <a href=\"http:\/\/www.maine.gov\/sos\/cec\/elec\/2010\/gen2010gov.html\" target=\"_blank\">19 percent<\/a> of Portland voters went for LePage in the 2010 election \u2013 there was no place he did worse.<\/p>\n<p>This summer, Dave Dearborn was sitting at a table in the high-ceilinged caf\u00e9 reading a book and nursing a coffee. Now, more than two years into the Republican\u2019s tenure, what did he think of the governor?<\/p>\n<p>\u201cHe outright embarrasses us with the idiotic things he says,\u201d Dearborn said.<\/p>\n<p>He said that after he finished his coffee, he was going up to the headquarters of a different candidate for governor, Eliot Cutler.<\/p>\n<p>Cutler is the independent and former Democrat who came in a close second to LePage and is hoping to do better in 2014. But he will be competing with a well-known Democrat, U. S. Rep. Mike Michaud, and LePage to be the governor.<\/p>\n<p>Dearborn said LePage \u201cplays on people\u2019s ignorance. He has a bombastic approach to politics that appeals to people who are willfully ignorant.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>About 90 miles away sits a Maine town where LePage\u2019s brand of politics went over better than it did in any other community of any size in the state.<\/p>\n<p>In Albion, a rural town in central Maine, LePage won by a landslide, with some to spare. He got <a href=\"http:\/\/www.maine.gov\/sos\/cec\/elec\/2010\/gen2010gov.html\" target=\"_blank\">nearly 61 per cent <\/a>of the vote from this town of 2,000.<\/p>\n<p>Locals there get their morning coffee at the Albion Corner Store at 14 Main St., where you can also all fill up your pickup and grab a slice and a Pepsi.<\/p>\n<p>At lunchtime in August, men in jeans and tee-shirts and some wearing fluorescent safety vests hurried in, joked with the women behind the lunch counter, ordered something \u201cto go\u201d and headed back to the job site.<\/p>\n<p>One of them was Brent Dow, 35, owner of a metal roofing company with four employees.<\/p>\n<aside class=\"module pull-quote right half\"><\/p>\n<p><center><img alt=\"Jill Goldthwait Photo\" src=\"http:\/\/pinetreewatchdog.org\/files\/2013\/10\/Im-not-sure-Im-aware-of-any-others-politicians-that-are-as-fearless-about-political-fallout.-Jill-Goldthwait-former-independent-state-senator.jpg\" width=\"215\" height=\"287\" \/><\/center>&#8220;I&#8217;m not sure I&#8217;m aware of any others (politicians) that are as fearless about political fallout.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-size: 15px;\">-Jill Goldthwait, former independent state senator<\/p>\n<p style=\"color: #666666; font-size: 12px;\">Photo, Colleen Delaney<\/p>\n<p><\/aside>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s kind of like me,\u201d Dow said, \u201cHe jokes a lot. He makes a lot of comments, but he stands by them. And some of them I agree with.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>What matters more to him, he said, was that LePage \u201cthinks like a worker \u2026 he\u2019s more for the working person than a person who has a state job or who found a way to stay on state benefits \u2026 He seems to go after those people.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Parris Varney, who owns the store with his wife Kathy, echoed Dow\u2019s assessment of the governor.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cTo me, he\u2019s not a typical politician. He\u2019s a little rough around the edges, but he says what other people think, but they don\u2019t say it,\u201d he said. \u201cHe\u2019s a regular guy.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The customers in Crema and the Albion Corner Store may be miles apart in their views, but they have something in common: They are representative of the public debate over the governor.<\/p>\n<p>Whether you are interviewing folks at coffee shops, reading letters to the editor and online comments or news coverage, most of the LePage debate has been about the sizzle, not the steak. About what he says and how he says it, not what he\u2019s done and not done.<\/p>\n<p>The Maine Center for Public Interest Reporting has interviewed LePage three times and more than two dozen others \u2013 from voters to political insiders to LePage\u2019s friends and enemies \u2013 to develop a fuller picture of the state\u2019s 74th governor.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/pinetreewatchdog.org\/the-biggest-baddest-person-around-crashes-augustas-nicey-nicey-club\/2\/\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-5236\" alt=\"next-page-btn\" src=\"http:\/\/pinetreewatchdog.org\/files\/2013\/10\/next-page-btn.png\" width=\"150\" height=\"30\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<aside class=\"module pull-quote right half\"><\/p>\n<p><center><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-5287\" alt=\"Tony Payne photo\" src=\"http:\/\/pinetreewatchdog.org\/files\/2013\/10\/LePage-has-moved-the-dial-on-policy-more-than-anyone-in-my-lifetime.-Tony-Payne-business-executive-and-conservative-political-activist.jpg\" width=\"200\" height=\"200\" \/><\/center>LePage &#8220;has moved the dial on policy more than anyone in my lifetime.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-size: 15px;\">-Tony Payne, business executive and conservative political activist<\/p>\n<p><\/aside><\/p>\n<p>What emerged was the story of the man behind the headlines, headlines that reflect one side &#8212; but one side only &#8212; of the state\u2019s chief executive.<\/p>\n<p>The picture also includes the stubborn former business consultant who has made foundational changes in the state\u2019s fiscal status; the populist who reflects the pent-up frustration of working people with what they see as Maine\u2019s profligate spending; the easily-frustrated CEO with little patience for the slow grind of the legislative process.<\/p>\n<p>And perhaps most telling: the anti-politician with his disdain for the sometime necessary tact required of political leaders, whose attitude may well be getting in the way of fulfilling more of his agenda.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m a lightning rod,\u201d LePage said in one of the interviews. He attracts &#8212; perhaps even courts \u2013 extreme reactions. He\u2019s been called everything from a bully to a moron by his detractors, while those closest to him see a personable, self-deprecating man who reads every bill, study and document on his desk.<\/p>\n<p>The middle ground on Paul LePage is a slim sandbar in the torrent of opinions, but among those few who stand there is Jill Goldthwait, a former independent state senator from Bar Harbor.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m sure that I don\u2019t know any others (politicians) that are as fearless about political fallout\u201d from their comments and positions as LePage, she said. His \u201csingle-mindedness has served him well,\u201d she said, but when his comments turn crude \u201cit interferes with his ability to accomplish his agenda.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>To Tony Payne, a self-described fiscal conservative and the one-time head of the Alliance for Maine\u2019s Future, a pro-business group, LePage \u201chas moved the dial on policy more than anyone in my lifetime, as no governor has, on more fronts \u2013 simultaneously.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Karen Heck, who succeeded LePage as mayor of Waterville, represents those disgusted with him. She said the governor\u2019s well-publicized comments show a lack of self-control that damages the state\u2019s image to potential new businesses \u2013 his supposed calling card.<\/p>\n<aside class=\"module pull-quote right half\"><\/p>\n<p><img alt=\"Lepage and chriistie photo\" src=\"http:\/\/pinetreewatchdog.org\/files\/2013\/10\/Lepage-and-chriistie-1.jpeg\" width=\"400\" height=\"286\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Author John Christie interviewing Gov.
