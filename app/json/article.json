Paul LePage. Only <a href=\"http:\/\/www.maine.gov\/sos\/cec\/elec\/2010\/gen2010gov.html\" target=\"_blank\">19 percent<\/a> of Portland voters went for LePage in the 2010 election \u2013 there was no place he did worse.<\/p>\n<p>This summer, Dave Dearborn was sitting at a table in the high-ceilinged caf\u00e9 reading a book and nursing a coffee. Now, more than two years into the Republican\u2019s tenure, what did he think of the governor?<\/p>\n<p>\u201cHe outright embarrasses us with the idiotic things he says,\u201d Dearborn said.<\/p>\n<p>He said that after he finished his coffee, he was going up to the headquarters of a different candidate for governor, Eliot Cutler.<\/p>\n<p>Cutler is the independent and former Democrat who came in a close second to LePage and is hoping to do better in 2014. But he will be competing with a well-known Democrat, U. S. Rep. Mike Michaud, and LePage to be the governor.<\/p>\n<p>Dearborn said LePage \u201cplays on people\u2019s ignorance. He has a bombastic approach to politics that appeals to people who are willfully ignorant.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>About 90 miles away sits a Maine town where LePage\u2019s brand of politics went over better than it did in any other community of any size in the state.<\/p>\n<p>In Albion, a rural town in central Maine, LePage won by a landslide, with some to spare. He got <a href=\"http:\/\/www.maine.gov\/sos\/cec\/elec\/2010\/gen2010gov.html\" target=\"_blank\">nearly 61 per cent <\/a>of the vote from this town of 2,000.<\/p>\n<p>Locals there get their morning coffee at the Albion Corner Store at 14 Main St., where you can also all fill up your pickup and grab a slice and a Pepsi.<\/p>\n<p>At lunchtime in August, men in jeans and tee-shirts and some wearing fluorescent safety vests hurried in, joked with the women behind the lunch counter, ordered something \u201cto go\u201d and headed back to the job site.<\/p>\n<p>One of them was Brent Dow, 35, owner of a metal roofing company with four employees.<\/p>\n<aside class=\"module pull-quote right half\"><\/p>\n<p><img alt=\"Jill Goldthwait Photo\" src=\"http:\/\/pinetreewatchdog.org\/files\/2013\/10\/Im-not-sure-Im-aware-of-any-others-politicians-that-are-as-fearless-about-political-fallout.-Jill-Goldthwait-former-independent-state-senator.jpg\" width=\"215\" height=\"287\" \/>&#8220;I&#8217;m not sure I&#8217;m aware of any others (politicians) that are as fearless about political fallout.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>-Jill Goldthwait, former independent state senator<\/p>\n<p>Photo, Colleen Delaney<\/p>\n<p><\/aside>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s kind of like me,\u201d Dow said, \u201cHe jokes a lot.

He\u2019s a little rough around the edges, but he says what other people think, but they don\u2019t say it,\u201d he said. \u201cHe\u2019s a regular guy.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The customers in Crema and the Albion Corner Store may be miles apart in their views, but they have something in common: They are representative of the public debate over the governor.<\/p>\n<p>Whether you are interviewing folks at coffee shops, reading letters to the editor and online comments or news coverage, most of the LePage debate has been about the sizzle, not the steak. About what he says and how he says it, not what he\u2019s done and not done.<\/p>\n<p>The Maine Center for Public Interest Reporting has interviewed LePage three times and more than two dozen others \u2013 from voters to political insiders to LePage\u2019s friends and enemies \u2013 to develop a fuller picture of the state\u2019s 74th governor.<\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<aside class=\"module pull-quote right half\"><\/p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-5287\" alt=\"Tony Payne photo\" src=\"http:\/\/pinetreewatchdog.org\/files\/2013\/10\/LePage-has-moved-the-dial-on-policy-more-than-anyone-in-my-lifetime.-Tony-Payne-business-executive-and-conservative-political-activist.jpg\" width=\"200\" height=\"200\" \/><br \/>\nLePage &#8220;has moved the dial on policy more than anyone in my lifetime.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>-Tony Payne, business executive and conservative political activist<\/p>\n<p><\/aside>\n<p>What emerged was the story of the man behind the headlines, headlines that reflect one side &#8212; but one side only &#8212; of the state\u2019s chief executive.<\/p>\n<p>The picture also includes the stubborn former business consultant who has made foundational changes in the state\u2019s fiscal status; the populist who reflects the pent-up frustration of working people with what they see as Maine\u2019s profligate spending; the easily-frustrated CEO with little patience for the slow grind of the legislative process.<\/p>\n<p>And perhaps most telling: the anti-politician with his disdain for the sometime necessary tact required of political leaders, whose attitude may well be getting in the way of fulfilling more of his agenda.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m a lightning rod,\u201d LePage said in one of the interviews.

His \u201csingle-mindedness has served him well,\u201d she said, but when his comments turn crude \u201cit interferes with his ability to accomplish his agenda.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>To Tony Payne, a self-described fiscal conservative and the one-time head of the Alliance for Maine\u2019s Future, a pro-business group, LePage \u201chas moved the dial on policy more than anyone in my lifetime, as no governor has, on more fronts \u2013 simultaneously.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Karen Heck, who succeeded LePage as mayor of Waterville, represents those disgusted with him.

The governor has never been a bully to me and, quite frankly, I would not have stood for it.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>In two sit-down interviews and one car trip from Augusta to Portland and back \u2013 a total of about six hours \u2013 the LePage of the screaming headlines showed up only once. But the one time offers an explanation for all the other outbursts:<\/p>\n<p>Replying to a question about working with legislators, he said: \u201cI hate politics,\u201d his voice rising, the \u201chate\u201d coming out in bold, all caps. \u201cI just hate having to compromise my principles.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-5307\" alt=\"chapter 1 graphic\" src=\"http:\/\/pinetreewatchdog.org\/files\/2013\/10\/chapter1.jpg\" width=\"680\" height=\"80\" \/>For most of the past 30 years, Maine voters were pretty clear what they wanted in the State House \u2013 Democrats, or independents with a liberal bent.<\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<p>Then why did a Tea Party-favorite like LePage get more votes in the last governor\u2019s race than a stalwart Democrat like Libby Mitchell or a classic good-government independent like Cutler?<\/p>\n<p>Severin Beliveau &#8212; the ultimate stalwart Democrat &#8212; had an answer: LePage\u2019s 38 percent win in the five-way race was an antidote to decades of progressive politics.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cPeople\u2019s sense was we needed a correction,\u201d said Beliveau, a partner in one of the state\u2019s leading law firms, PretiFlaherty, whose party bona fides are as long and as impressive as his success as a lobbyist.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cHe was conveying a message that was well-received\u201d in 2009, when voters went for not only a conservative candidate for governor but elected a Republican House and Senate.<\/p>\n<p>The rough-and-tough image LePage projected in the campaign was no creation of slick campaign advisers. He grew up on the streets of gritty Lewiston; ran Marden\u2019s, a statewide discount chain, so he knew how to make a good deal; and was mayor of Waterville, where voters liked his fiscal management. He promised to cut spending, lower taxes, pay off the state\u2019s debt and end Maine\u2019s reputation as a welfare state.<\/p>\n<p>LePage, Beliveau said, \u201cexpressed the frustration of many Americans \u2026 the fact that we\u2019re still in a recession and had more than a dozen years of Democratic control.

John Baldacci moved out of the Blaine House and LePage moved in, there were two potentially crushing liabilities on the state\u2019s balance sheet:<a href=\"http:\/\/pinetreewatchdog.org\/looming-bill-for-pensions-will-command-larger-share-of-taxes-paid-to-state\/\" target=\"_blank\"> multi-million-dollar debts<\/a> to the state\u2019s pension system and <a href=\"http:\/\/www.businessweek.com\/ap\/financialnews\/D9IRM98G2.htm\" target=\"_blank\">to hospitals for late Medicaid payments.<\/a><\/p>\n<p>LePage is known mostly as the former general manager of Marden\u2019s string of discount stores, but before that he was a \u201cturn-around\u201d specialist \u2013 the MBA you hire when your business is on the ropes, often due to too much debt, overspending and inefficiencies.<\/p>\n<p>One of LePage\u2019s oldest friends and golf buddies is Alan Rancourt, the president of Kennebec Federal Savings in Waterville, who recalled LePage\u2019s days as an executive at the now-defunct Scott Paper plant in Winslow and as a gun-for-hire business consultant.<\/p>\n<p>He said when LePage came into those jobs the first thing he did was \u201cget the invoices \u2026 you paid the people who supplied the lumber because if you don\u2019t pay them, then the whole process goes away.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The \u201cinvoices\u201d on his desk when LePage was inaugurated on Jan. 5, 2011 included <a href=\"http:\/\/www.impaq.me\/l\/dAHmRQFZKA\" target=\"_blank\">$4.4 billion<\/a> in debt to the pension system because the state <a href=\"http:\/\/www.impaq.me\/l\/dAHmRQFZKA\" target=\"_blank\">had underpaid into the system<\/a> for years and pension investments took a hit from the recession.<\/p>\n<p>Unless something was done about the debt, it would soon go from eating up 10 per cent of the state budget to 20 percent, a calculation based on pension records and budget projections.<\/p>\n<p>In early 2010, Caron, citing the Brookings report, said the pension debt was \u201ca ticking time bomb that the next governor will inherit. There isn\u2019t going to be enough money to do what we\u2019re already committed to doing, much less doing more of what we should be doing.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>During the campaign, both <a href=\"http:\/\/www.impaq.me\/l\/jzW1Ug-G9A\" target=\"_blank\">LePage and Cutler vowed to deal<\/a> with the debt if they won; the Democratic nominee, <a href=\"http:\/\/pinetreewatchdog.org\/governors-race-pension-time-bomb-missing-in-action-from-candidates-platforms\/\" target=\"_blank\">Libby Mitchell<\/a>, did not make the pension debt an issue and believed future investment returns would solve the problem \u2013 a view the Democratic-appointed head of the pension board did not endorse.<\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<p>Reducing the pension debt was one of LePage\u2019s early achievements \u2013 although he didn\u2019t do it alone. He initiated <a href=\"http:\/\/www.impaq.me\/l\/92gN2F0XrQ\" target=\"_blank\">a plan<\/a>, but it was modified by the legislature\u2019s appropriations committee. The debt reduction came from the wallets of current and future retirees whose future pensions will be limited by a severe cutback in their cost of living provisions. (Pensioners will be eligible for cost of living increases in the future if the state has a budget surplus.)<\/p>\n<p>In all the years the debt was building, the lone voice calling attention to the looming budget crisis was Republican Peter Mills, a longtime member of the legislature.<\/p>\n<aside class=\"module pull-quote right half\"><\/p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-5286\" alt=\"Severin Beliveau photo\" src=\"http:\/\/pinetreewatchdog.org\/files\/2013\/10\/\u201cPeople\u2019s-sense-was-that-we-needed-a-correction.\u201d-Severin-Beliveau-attorney-lobbyist-and-Democratic-Party-elder.jpg\" width=\"200\" height=\"248\" \/><\/p>\n<p>\u201cPeople\u2019s sense was we needed a correction.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>- Severin Beliveau, attorney, lobbyist and Democratic Party elder<\/p>\n<p>Photo: Bangor Daily News<\/p>\n<p><\/aside>\n<p>Mills, who lost to LePage in the 2010 primary, considers the pension legislation the governor\u2019s \u201csingle biggest achievement,\u201d an opinion echoed by many of the those interviewed for this story.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThat dropped $1.7 billion off the pension liability,\u201d said Mills, currently the head of the Maine Turnpike Authority. \u201cIf he had not been elected governor and the Republicans had not taken power in 2010, it\u2019s safe to say that would not have happened.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Caron said the pension debt \u201cwas going to bankrupt the state if we didn\u2019t so something about it.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>LePage himself puts the pension bill second on his list of achievements \u2013 <a href=\"http:\/\/www.sunjournal.com\/hospitaldebt09192013\" target=\"_blank\">\u201cPaying the hospital debt<\/a> was the most important \u2026 that was the hardest one.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>That $183.5 million debt for underpaying Medicare bills from the hospitals had been building for at least 10 years when Democrats controlled the State House.

LD1 was one of LePage\u2019s first <a href=\"http:\/\/www.onlinesentinel.com\/news\/environment-lepage-proposeschanges-to-laws_2011-01-24.html\" target=\"_blank\">initiatives<\/a> and was crafted by advisor, corporate lobbyist and Preti Flaherty partner Robinson. The legislation proposed rolling back some of Maine\u2019s pioneering laws that limited the public\u2019s exposure to toxic chemicals, including the chemical BPA, abolishing the state Board of Environmental Protection (BEP) and other steps.<\/p>\n<p>It was greeted with outrage by the state\u2019s environmentalists.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;This list is reckless and appalling. It puts our health at risk, it puts our environment at risk, our clean air, our clean drinking water at risk,&#8221; said Maureen Drouin, executive director of the Maine League of Conservation Voters.<\/p>\n<p>The bill that LePage ultimately <a href=\"http:\/\/www.pressherald.com\/news\/regulatory-reform-a-change-in-attitude_2011-06-14.html\" target=\"_blank\">signed<\/a> was dramatically scaled back by lawmakers, but still streamlined permitting processes, cut the number of members on the BEP, established environmental self-auditing programs for businesses and instituted business assistance programs at the state&#8217;s economic development department.<\/p>\n<p>Many of its most controversial environmental proposals were split off from the original bill and sent to legislative committees for further review.<\/p>\n<p>Beliveau sees LePage\u2019s attitude towards the traditional liberal interests groups as a refreshing change.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI think this is the first governor in ages that is not indebted to the MSEA, NRCM and MEA,\u201d he said referring to the state employees\u2019 union, the environmental advocacy group and the teachers\u2019 union. Both unions are major contributors to Democratic candidates.<\/p>\n<p>LePage, Beliveau said, \u201chas succeeded by challenging them, confronting them and in many ways provided balance where it had not existed earlier.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>His firm represented Plum Creek Development when it applied during the Baldacci administration for LURC permits to develop around Moosehead Lake. If LePage had been governor, Beliveau speculated, it would not have taken three years \u201cand millions and millions in counsel fees, expert witnesses \u2026 and a whole slug of experts we had to pay.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The plan was eventually approved with modifications, \u201cbut it was torturous,\u201d he said.<\/p>\n<p>And to those who say agencies like the DEP have become less environmentally sensitive and more business-oriented, the 75-year-old Beliveau had the classic response of a veteran political hand: \u201cElections have consequences.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The idea that LePage has put good business practices into place in state government grates on Cutler, an attorney, a former budget official in the Carter administration and an international business consultant.<\/p>\n<p>While Cutler cited some areas where LePage has succeeded &#8212; pension reform, charter school legislation, questioning state spending \u2013 he said the governor\u2019s style \u201cis a slap in the face to most responsible business leaders.\u201d<\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ve put good practices in place in government \u2026 It\u2019s hard work and it\u2019s collaborative,\u201d Cutler said. To succeed, it needs to be \u201ca shared enterprise and have a common sense of purpose. And we don\u2019t have that in Maine today.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>When it comes to measuring LePage\u2019s track record on jobs and the economy, there is also empirical data, such as the employment rate.<\/p>\n<p>Two-and-a-half years onto LePage\u2019s four-year term, Maine\u2019s unemployment rate stood at <a href=\"http:\/\/www.state.me.us\/labor\/cwri\/laus.html\" target=\"_blank\">6.9 percent and the U.S. rate at 7.4.<\/a><\/p>\n<p>During that period, the Maine rate dropped 1.1 percentage points, or about 14 percent. That\u2019s not as good as the national drop of 1.7 points or almost 19 percent. But in July, the US rate had gotten a bit worse and the state\u2019s rate a little better.<\/p>\n<aside class=\"module pull-quote right half\"><\/p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-5301\" alt=\"I\u2019m a lightning rod.\" src=\"http:\/\/pinetreewatchdog.org\/files\/2013\/10\/I\u2019m-a-lightning-rod..jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"354\" \/><\/p>\n<p>&#8220;I\u2019m a lightning rod.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Jeff Pouland Photography<\/p>\n<p><\/aside>\n<p>The Maine unemployment rate has been <a href=\"http:\/\/www.state.me.us\/labor\/cwri\/laus.html\" target=\"_blank\">better than the U.S.<\/a> rate throughout LePage\u2019s term; but it was <a href=\"http:\/\/www.state.me.us\/labor\/cwri\/laus.html\" target=\"_blank\">worse than the U.S.<\/a> during parts of Baldacci\u2019s two terms.<\/p>\n<p>Another widely-cited statistic is the percentage of the population with jobs.

Both started to turn around about the time LePage took office, with the US numbers going up 9.4 percent and the state\u2019s 4.1 percent in the last 2.5 years.<\/p>\n<p>But the Fed sees a rosier picture ahead for Maine \u2013 it is one of only 17 states <a href=\"http:\/\/www.philadelphiafed.org\/research-and-data\/regional-economy\/indexes\/coincident\/maps\/2013\/2013-05.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">projected to grow faster<\/a> than the nation over the next six months.<\/p>\n<p>When it comes to job creation, The <a href=\"http:\/\/www.bizjournals.com\/bizjournals\/on-numbers\/scott-thomas\/2013\/06\/43-paul-lepage.html\" target=\"_blank\">Business Journals<\/a> said Maine ranked 43 of 45 states measured as of May, adding private jobs at about half the national average over 12 months. A <a href=\"http:\/\/www.sunjournal.com\/news\/1428599\" target=\"_blank\">report<\/a> by the Pew Center said Maine added about 200 private jobs from April 2012 to April 2013.<\/p>\n<p>In September, Forbes magazine \u00a0&#8211; for the fourth year in a row &#8212; ranked Maine the worst state in the nation for business expansion, the driver of private job creation.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cNot much has changed,\u201d\u00a0Forbes said. Maine \u201cis still burdened with an aging population and a weak economic forecast. Job growth projections are the worst in the U.S \u2026\u201d<\/p>\n<p>LePage responded by saying the ranking is a legacy of the years of Democratic rule. Glenn Mills, chief economist at the Maine Department of Labor\u2019s Center for Workforce Research and Information, <a href=\"http:\/\/bangordailynews.com\/2013\/09\/27\/business\/maine-remains-worst-state-for-business-forbes-says\/\" target=\"_blank\">told<\/a> the Bangor Daily News that \u201cmany of the reasons for Maine\u2019s poor ranking by Forbes can be traced to its aging population, which affects everything from the available labor pool to wages.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>What do all the statistics mean?<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe are growing, but not as fast as we would like.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>That\u2019s the assessment of James Clair. Clair is the chairman of the state\u2019s <a href=\"http:\/\/www.maine.gov\/legis\/ofpr\/revenue_forecasting_committee\/consensus_economic_forecast\/\" target=\"_blank\">Consensus Economic Forecasting Commission<\/a>, the CEO of Goold Health Care Systems and a former non-partisan staffer to the Legislature\u2019s Appropriations Committee. He holds a master\u2019s degree in public administration from Syracuse University.<\/p>\n<p>One area he sees \u201cgetting pretty strong\u201d is personal income. Last year, Maine\u2019s 3.4 percent growth in personal income was the slowest rate of any state and far below the national average of 5.1 percent. But the more up-to-date report by the federal <a href=\"http:\/\/www.bea.gov\/index.htm\" target=\"_blank\">Bureau of Economic Analysis<\/a> tells a better story for Maine. While all but one state showed declines in personal income growth, Maine\u2019s decline was among the smallest, ranking better than 31 other states.<\/p>\n<p>Bottom line for Clair: \u201cWe\u2019re having some growth, but it could be better.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-5330\" alt=\"chapter 4\" src=\"http:\/\/pinetreewatchdog.org\/files\/2013\/10\/chapter4-.jpg\" width=\"680\" height=\"80\" \/><\/p>\n<p>The left, the right and just about everyone in-between has long agreed on one thing about Maine\u2019s taxes &#8212; the income tax had to be fixed.<\/p>\n<p>The main problem with it was that it treated working people like they were rich.

It wasn\u2019t long after that that Democrats, who had control of the legislature and governor\u2019s office, came up with a plan to lower the income tax rate.<\/p>\n<p>Championed by Democratic state Rep. John Piotti, it called for a flat tax rate of 6.5 percent but a broadening of the sales tax to make up for the lost income tax revenue. Politically, Democrats would not support a plan that reduced state revenues and required cuts in spending.<\/p>\n<p>It passed the legislature and was signed into law by Baldacci, but voters killed the plan in a June 2010 referendum, its failure widely attributed to the sales tax hikes and to Gov. John Baldacci\u2019s changes to the bill exempting some favored businesses, such as real estate and skiing, from the new sales tax.<\/p>\n<p>State Sen. Joe Perry, D-Bangor, told AP the vote marked 40 years of failed attempts to reform Maine\u2019s taxes, putting Maine at a competitive disadvantage with other states.<\/p>\n<p>Then came another vote just five months later &#8212; the election of LePage, who in the recent interviews with the Center described his political philosophy: \u201cI don\u2019t define myself as a Republican. I define myself as a conservative, as someone who believes in self-reliance, smaller government \u2013 and only enough taxes to run the show.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Now, the income tax problem was back on the table \u2013 and the timing was perfect.

That group is counted as 19,503 \u201ctax families.\u201d<\/li>\n<li>The biggest change in taxes on a dollar basis goes to the tax families making $325,974 and above. Their taxes will down $3,021 per family. There are 6,643 families in this group.<\/li>\n<li>A broader view comes by looking at the middle \u2013 those making from about $33,000 to roughly $87,000, about 40 percent of all taxpayers. Their taxes go down about 8.6 percent. On an annual basis, this group\u2019s average savings is about $220.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Interpretations of the new tax have been a projective test of where you stand on the ideological spectrum. Those that call it a giveaway to the wealthy tend to be left-leaning Democrats and progressives.

Even though the legislature restored some of those cuts, the reduction is translating into higher tax rates in some cities and towns, although it is too early in the tax cycle to have precise data.<\/p>\n<p>LePage has mixed feelings when he reflects on the tax cut.<\/p>\n<p>On the one hand, he boasts that 70,000 people no longer pay taxes and that 450,000 of 630,000 Mainers got a tax reduction. On the other, he said, \u201cWe were better off not lowering at all compared to what we\u2019re doing now.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The \u201cnow\u201d is the <a href=\"http:\/\/bangordailynews.com\/2013\/06\/26\/politics\/state-house\/maine-house-overrides-lepage-budget-veto-fate-rests-with-senate\/\" target=\"_blank\">budget the legislature approved<\/a> &#8212; over his veto &#8212; that temporarily raises taxes on meals, lodging and the sales tax rate.<\/p>\n<p>One reason legislators increased taxes was to make up for the millions they added back to revenue sharing. Opponents to the LePage-sized cuts predicted those cuts would cause local taxes to rise. If that happened \u2013 and it has in some communities \u2013 it could hurt legislators\u2019 chances for reelection in 2014.<\/p>\n<p>LePage doesn\u2019t buy the argument that cities and towns had to raise taxes to make up for the loss in revenue sharing. Instead, he said they should do what he did with some success as mayor of Waterville \u2013 consolidate.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cTake a look at Lewiston,\u201d he said. \u201cThirty-six thousand people. They have one town manager, one police chief, one fire chief, one public works director, one superintendent (of schools), one tax assessor. Then you go back to Waterville, Winslow, Fairfield and Oakland,\u201d he said, slapping his hand on the dining room table with the name of each town. \u201cFour communities and they have roughly 36,000, maybe 37,000, people and they have 24 administrators.

From his admitted \u201cbig mouth\u201d to his attacks on the legacy policies of Democratic rule, LePage seems to be on page one every day.<\/p>\n<p>For 16 years, Maine\u2019s governors \u2013 Baldacci and King \u2013 stood slightly to the left-of-middle on most issues and rarely made news with off-hand commentaries.<\/p>\n<p>Baldacci, the Democrat, is a lifetime politician, with that hale-fellow- well-met personality that suited his profession. King, now a U. S. senator, is officially an independent, but caucuses with the Democrats. He is as charming as a Reagan, speaks as well as a network anchorman and comes dressed in L.L. Bean khaki.<\/p>\n<p>Three years ago, voters changed direction and along came LePage, the linebacker-shaped former homeless Franco from Lewiston who does not turn his nose up at the tea party.<\/p>\n<p>As longtime friend and Waterville car dealer Charlie Gaunce said of LePage: \u201cI\u2019d rather have a fighter in there than a marshmallow \u2026 he\u2019s not a great orator. We don\u2019t need that.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>From education to energy, welfare to health care, the governor\u2019s proposals have shaken up Augusta \u2013 which is one reason he makes the news almost every day.<\/p>\n<p>In the past, the theme that ran through many of the policies from governors and the legislature might be best summed up in a favorite term from their tenures: \u201cprotect our most vulnerable citizens.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>While conservatives like LePage say they also want to protect the needy, they put a greater emphasis on responsibility and accountability, which showed up in proposals such as <a href=\"http:\/\/www.maine.gov\/doe\/schoolreportcards\/reportcards\/allreports.html\" target=\"_blank\">letter grades<\/a> for public schools. Based on standardized tests and other criteria, schools are graded A-F by LePage\u2019s Department of Education.<\/p>\n<p>He saw it as a way to get attention to what he has said is a core problem in the state\u2019s economy \u2013 Maine\u2019s public schools are serving administrators and teacher unions well, but not teachers and students. If parents hold schools accountable for a poor grade, \u201cthe schools improve,\u201d he said.<\/p>\n<p>It will take some time to know if he is right, but school officials, education groups, Democrats and editorials railed again the program, using terms like \u201clabeling\u201d \u201cthreatening,\u201d \u201cshameful,\u201d \u201cfaulty\u201d and \u201cuncompassionate.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>But grading schools isn\u2019t just a conservative fad: About four months after LePage\u2019s grading system was announced, another political figure \u2013 President Barack Obama &#8212; proposed <a href=\"http:\/\/www.whitehouse.gov\/the-press-office\/2013\/08\/22\/fact-sheet-president-s-plan-make-college-more-affordable-better-bargain-\" target=\"_blank\">grading the country\u2019s colleges<\/a> to help parents and students know if the money they spent produced good results.<\/p>\n<p>LePage said one of the two biggest disappointments so far was his failure to pass another education accountability bill.<\/p>\n<p>The legislature\u2019s education committee unanimously rejected LD 1524. The bill would have required public colleges to track the number of remedial courses needed by incoming high school students in math and language arts.<\/p>\n<p>LePage has said, for example, that 54 percent of the students going into community colleges need such help (a statistic that has been confirmed by the college system). The originating high schools would have to pay for those remedial colleges if LePage\u2019s bill had passed.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cOur education is not a bad education,\u201d he said. \u201cWe just haven\u2019t ticked up and everyone else has.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>That assessment seems to have been <a href=\"http:\/\/bangordailynews.com\/2012\/07\/27\/politics\/lepages-plan-to-force-schools-to-reimburse-colleges-for-remedial-education-rejected-in-other-states\/\" target=\"_blank\">confirmed<\/a> by an expert interviewed by the Bangor Daily News July 27 last year after a Harvard study ranked Maine public schools next to last for rate of improvement of the 41 participating states.<\/p>\n<p>Paul Peterson, professor of government at Harvard\u2019s Kennedy School of Government, said, \u201cMaine is one of those states that hasn\u2019t shown much gain over\u201d the last 20 years.<\/p>\n<p>Democrats and advocacy groups never denied that Maine\u2019s schools needed to be better, but their ideas vs. LePage\u2019s tell the bigger story of how each side sees the role of government.<\/p>\n<p>Democrats proposed legislation to give more aid and encouragement to schools doing poorly, rather than calling then out.<\/p>\n<p>LePage and his supporters don\u2019t mind if some of those on the public payroll feel insulted.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s all about accountability,\u201d LePage said.<\/p>\n<p>To conservatives like LePage, accountability goes hand-in-hand with personal responsibility. His legislation, for example, to put a lifetime cap of five years on Temporary Aid to Needy families (TANF), fulfilled a campaign promise to limit welfare.<\/p>\n<p>Other welfare changes included drug testing for welfare recipients already convicted of drug offenses and denying TANF and food stamp benefits to immigrants who were legal residents. Maine was among only a handful of states to provide substantial benefits to legal resident immigrants.<\/p>\n<p>According to the LePage administration, the limits resulted in a 41 percent decrease in TANF benefits between the bill\u2019s enactment and now.<\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<aside class=\"module pull-quote right half\"><\/p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-5302\" alt=\"accountability\" src=\"http:\/\/pinetreewatchdog.org\/files\/2013\/10\/It\u2019s-all-about-accountability..jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"290\" \/><\/p>\n<p>&#8220;It\u2019s all about accountability.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Jeff Pouland Photography<\/p>\n<p><\/aside>\n<p>But that decrease hasn\u2019t meant demand for help has disappeared. The state\u2019s cities and towns say LePage\u2019s reforms simply shifted the cost of public assistance to them and they\u2019re now bearing the burden of helping out poor families through General Assistance, which is funded in part by local taxpayers.<\/p>\n<p>LePage considers his second failure to be another welfare change he wanted \u2013 but didn\u2019t get.<\/p>\n<p>LePage \u2013 with support from a handful of members of both parties \u2013 wanted the state to get federal permission to ban the use of food stamps to buy soft drinks and snack food.<\/p>\n<p>The bill, LD 1411, was killed \u2013 and in the process more was revealed about the fundamental differences between LePage and prevailing liberal sentiment in the legislature. While he wanted to require more nutritious food purchases by people on public assistance, the Senate Democrats wanted to teach people to eat healthier \u2013 but not require anything.<\/p>\n<p>That would avoid stigmatizing the state\u2019s poor residents, said Sen. Margaret Craven, D-Lewiston, according to the Bangor Daily News.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cTreating people who are poor differently, I think, undermines their humanity and undermines our humanity for treating them that way,\u201d she said.<\/p>\n<p>The loss seemed to pain LePage.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cLosing that nutrition thing was a heartbreak,\u201d he said. \u201cWe failed.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Two staff members present for the interview interrupted and said the failure wasn\u2019t his \u2013 it was the legislature\u2019s.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d he shot back at them. \u201cMy administration failed.

Two years into the LePage administration, things had improved a bit \u2013 the state was 24 percent above the national average and 12th highest in the country.<\/p>\n<p>The improvement was due to a decrease in the price of natural gas in New England, from which electricity prices are set.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe were lucky,\u201d admitted Patrick Woodcock, the head of the LePage energy office.<\/p>\n<p>But luck will only gets you so far, and Woodcock said those prices are starting to tick up.<\/p>\n<p>LePage\u2019s approach to more permanent solutions reveals &#8212; once again &#8212; his philosophical differences with the once-prevalent thinking in state government.<\/p>\n<p>Democrats have generally come at the energy issue from a policy angle, stressing the environment. Thus, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.impaq.me\/l\/JXhwvcid6g\" target=\"_blank\">Gov. John Baldacci\u2019s efforts<\/a> to make Maine a major producer of wind power, a strategy that is <a href=\"http:\/\/www.impaq.me\/l\/u7xRjwcDLQ\" target=\"_blank\">still being debated<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>LePage comes at it from the point of view of the consumer, the family spending too much to heat their home and the businessman who pays more for electricity than competitors.<\/p>\n<p>He has been a cheerleader for the expansion of natural gas in Maine, including converting many state buildings to the cheaper fuel. And much of greater Augusta is being torn up right now to lay gas pipelines to business and homes.<\/p>\n<p>Woodcock said LePage\u2019s early support of natural gas \u201cwas controversial at the time. The inherent market was oil and those businesses were really opposed to the initiative.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Woodcock credits LePage\u2019s appointments to the Public Utilities Commission for making a change in regulations that includes a $1,200 rebate to convert a home to natural gas use. \u201cThat\u2019s been driving this growth,\u201d Woodcock said.<\/p>\n<p>He cites another innovation by LePage that will help homeowners deal with the cost of keeping their homes warm that required the governor to modify his conservative opposition to the cap-and-trade plan known as RGGI.<\/p>\n<p>Now, about $9 million of the $40 million RGGI funds will go to the Efficiency Maine Trust, a quasi state agency, to help homeowners modernize their heating systems.<\/p>\n<p>Steve Ward is the former state public advocate, a position created to represent consumers before the Public Utilities Commission (he held the position for 20 years) and is currently chair of the Maine Center for Economic Policy, a progressive think thank and advocacy group based in Augusta.<\/p>\n<p>He said, \u201cIf the LePage administration played any important role in stimulating the second round of gas\u00a0infrastructure\u00a0build-out that we are now witnessing, they had a great deal of company: big paper companies and their lawyers, entrepreneurial gas developers like Summit and many (but not all) environmental organizations in Maine.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Woodcock agreed that business interests played a major role.<\/p>\n<p>Ward supports the new use of the RGGI funds because they will be used \u201cfor converting obsolete and dangerous furnaces in low-income homes to cheaper and cleaner fuels \u2026\u201d<\/p>\n<p>But he added that the RGGI money was part of the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.mainelegislature.org\/legis\/bills\/display_ps.asp?ld=1559&amp;PID=1456&amp;snum=126\" target=\"_blank\">omnibus energy bill<\/a> that LePage vetoed (the veto was overridden). \u201cThe most\u00a0positive\u00a0achievement\u201d of the Act, Ward said, was to give authority over funding for the Efficiency Maine&#8217;s programs to the professionals at the PUC and\u00a0not the legislature, where it is subject to \u201cpolitical maneuvering.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The chief reason for LePage\u2019s opposition to the bill was that it did not scale back the state\u2019s ambitious wind power goals, which, he has said, give wind an unfair advantage over other forms of energy.

To the people not in that inner circle, they loved it because nobody extends to them that courtesy and fair play.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>His economic adviser, John Butera, one of the Waterville pals he brought with him to the State House, said, \u201cHe doesn\u2019t care if anyone likes him.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>It was pointed out to him that a lot people say that when they\u2019re under attack.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI know,\u201d he said. \u201cBut he really doesn\u2019t care if anyone likes him.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>LePage did not disagree: \u201cI want them (legislators) to respect that I\u2019m trying to do the best I can \u2026 If I wanted to be liked, I\u2019d get another dog. If I want to get loved, I\u2019ll go home.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Eves, the speaker of the house, is one of the two Democratic legislative leaders LePage has to work with in the second two years of his four-term term. The results of that relationship are perhaps best expressed by the number of bills LePage vetoed this year: <a href=\"http:\/\/www.pressherald.com\/politics\/override-bids-leave-most-vetoes-standing_2013-07-10.html?pagenum=full\" target=\"_blank\">a record 83.<\/a><\/p>\n<p>Eves, a family therapist, likened LePage to a teenager whose \u201cparents\u201d\u2013 Republicans in the legislature \u2013 \u201care complicit in this behavior. They enable him. When he sees he can get away with it, he keeps doing it.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>While Eves has run the House, state Sen. Justin Alfond of Portland has led the other chamber as senate president.<\/p>\n<p>LePage called Eves a \u201csmart young guy who is inexperienced\u201d and quickly added a less flattering take on Alfond, who he has known from Alfond\u2019s youthful years growing up in the Waterville area, the grandson and an heir of up-from-the-bootstraps multi-millionaire Harold Alfond, who died in 2007. Alfond owned Dexter shoes, a business he famously sold to billionaire investor Warren Buffett, and was Maine\u2019s best-known philanthropist.<\/p>\n<p>As figures in Waterville, LePage knew the grandfather and his sons as well, and spoke highly of all of them. Not so the grandson.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI can\u2019t say anything good about Justin \u2026 Harold Alfond, I think was a great guy. Justin\u2019s dad (Bill), I love to pieces, I think he\u2019s a great guy,\u201d LePage said. But, of the 38-year-old Justin he said, \u201cNot very bright, and very, uh, well, here\u2019s how I\u2019ll characterize Justin Alfond: Spoiled brat. Both in his personal life and his politics. Justin is very fortunate that his father and his grandfather were born ahead of him.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Repeated requests to speak to Alfond never resulted in an interview.<\/p>\n<p>But when he speaks publically of LePage, it is often to attack the governor where he wants to be seen as strongest \u2014 as a friend of business.<\/p>\n<p>For example, regarding the Statoil deal, Alfond told the AP: &#8220;What we have seen once again is how far this governor is willing to go to stop you dead in your tracks if he is against you. And it doesn&#8217;t matter if you are an individual or a company that wants to invest millions of dollars.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>To LePage, Alfond is the poster boy of those \u201celites\u201d that he teases his daughter about being \u2013 the subset of Mainers who turn their noses up at LePage\u2019s tea party policies and crude remarks.<\/p>\n<p>Rick Bennett is the former Republican president of the Senate and is seen as a moderate member of his party. He took over as state party chairman this summer. The \u201cdiscomfort,\u201d he said, between LePage and so-called \u201celites\u201d goes both ways.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThey are the people who are doing fine and they find him a bit off-putting \u2026 they like Maine the way it is,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of entrenchment from the people who have it good.\u201d<\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<p><strong>Scene 2<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><em>Location: The law office of Republican state Sen.
